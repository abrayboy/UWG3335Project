    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h2>I am looking to restore my car. Do you only do paint?</h2>
    <p>
        No, we can do your complete restoration! We take pride in offering not only quality paint jobs, <br />
        but in quality full builds. Let us make your dreams come true!<br />
    </p>

    <h2>How much will it cost?</h2>
    <p>
        Our shop rate is $75 per hour, plus the cost of materials, supplies, and parts (if needed); with<br />
        that said, the total cost varies greatly depending on the magnitude of the<br />
        restoration and the condition at drop off (i.e. rust repair, custom fabrication required, etc). Though we stay in<br />
        constant communication with our customers throughout the build, discuss problems and<br />
        changes recommended, etc. there is no way to bid a job accurately before getting into it.<br />
        When it comes to custom paint work, this is based on a per job bases and KC will discuss<br />
        the costs and process with you up front.<br />
        </p>

    <h2>Can you give me a quote?</h2>
    <p>
        No, until we begin work on the car and determine what is under all the layers, etc., we have no idea!<br />
        There is great variability when dealing with old cars, and that requires a complete <br />
        understanding of all the required work, and therefore we cannot commit to an estimate beforehand.<br />
        As for custom paint work, we are able to offer quotes per job.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Will you come check out my vehicle before I bring it in?</h2>
    <p>This is on a case by case basis. KC typically spends time discussing your project over the phone<br /> 
       and reviewing emailed photos prior to bringing it in.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Another shop has my car in primer, can you paint it?</h2>
    <p>We cannot paint a vehicle over body work we did not do. We will be happy to paint it but we
       will be taking it all the way back down first.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>What about rust?</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, rust repair is difficult to estimate; paints and fillers hide a lot of corrosion that<br />
       we won’t be able to see until vehicle is stripped. Rust is insidious in nature and tends to attack<br />
       panels from the inside out so by time you see the damage, there is considerably more you don’t see.<br />
       This is why prep is key to any quality paint job.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>What parts will need to be purchased?</h2>
    <p>This is mostly up to the customer and the magnitude of the build.  This is discussed with KC in<br />
       the beginning stages and he will gladly offer suggestions and work with you to come up with<br />
       the best plan for your vehicle. <br />
    </p>

    <h2>How does payment work for restorations?</h2>
    <p>We require a deposit at drop off (or to hold place on schedule). We e-bill bi-weekly thereafter. <br />
       Payments can be made online through invoice, in person, or by mailed, whichever is <br />
       most convenient for the customer.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>How many hours are typical to restore?</h2>
    <p>It is difficult to predict the hours required for a restoration. Once we have gone over your<br />
       vehicle and created an estimate, we will have a rough idea of the hours required for the project; <br />
       however, even after a thorough initial examination, the extent of rust, damage, and state of <br />
       the parts under paint, fillers, and panels cannot be determined.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Can we restore the vehicle in stages?</h2>
    <p>Yes, whether you wish to complete some of the phases or you want to stagger the restoration<br />
       for budgetary reasons, we can accommodate your requirements and work with you.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Will I get reports on progress?</h2>
    <p>Yes, we will provide updates with the invoice bi-weekly, usually photos as well!<br />
       KC also updates by phone, text, or email often.<br />
